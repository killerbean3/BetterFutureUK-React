    info: ` As part of a lived experiences week for students at Salford University, I invited Dom to speak to students about his experiences and to share his story.
Dom was very courageous to stand up and speak to students whom he had never met,  and his insightful account of his own experiences was truly inspiring.
Dom was truly brilliant and his passionate and clear account of his own struggles was very insightful for all of us .
I was very grateful for Doms's account and it has given so many students a better insight and will help them understand individuals better and help that gain a better quality of care.
I would highly recommend Dom to speak as his experiences can only help devlop a greater understanding`,

    info: ` It was a great benefit to hear from all the speakers about their experiences with different mental health conditions and the experiences they have had with services, stigma, community resources, and various coping mechanisms that have been helpful. It also helped to highlight and reinforce the impact that the attitude and actions of people involved in the care of a person can have on a person's experience of services/interactions. Thank you again for putting it together, and to all the speakers for taking the time to speak to us, share their experiences, and answer our questions.`,
